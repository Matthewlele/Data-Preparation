# Data Preparation

This repository contains two distinct data processing projects focused on different aspects of data collection, analysis, and mining.
## Projects Overview

### Data Preprocessing (`data_preprocessing/`)

A data analysis and preprocessing project working with the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023" dataset. This project focuses on:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical analysis, data quality assessment, and visualization of music streaming data
- **Data Mining Preparation**: Data normalizationand discretization
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions
- **Feature Analysis**: Correlation analysis and relationship exploration between musical attributes


### Data Scraping (`data_scraping/`)

A web scraping solution designed to extract bicycle product information from e-commerce website. This project demonstrates:

- **Automated Data Collection**: Scraping product URLs and detailed specifications
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Data extraction using rate-limited concurrent requests
- **Structured Data Output**: TSV-formatted data ready for analysis

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Web Scraping**: Asynchronous HTTP requests and HTML parsing
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis, descriptive statistics
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn for plots and charts
